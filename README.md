# FPTS
A Financial Portfolio Tracking system, that uses Yahoo API Web Service to update a user's tracked stock prices in the system. 

This was a class project designated to increase our familiarity with the Gang of Four Design Patters. 
	Some design patterns that were employed are Memento, Command, and Strategy.
	
We used the MVC pattern to structure our subsystems.

Some tools that were used on the GUI side of things were JavaFX which was mostly put together with the help of SceneBuilder 2.0. 			Subversion was used for version control.

Since this was a class project. There were many things that were not implemented to the best of our ability due to time tradeoffs that had to be made with other classwork.
